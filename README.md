# Cleaning The Dataset

1.  **Removed the dollar sign ($)** from both the 'Profit' and 'Sales' columns.
   - This step was crucial to enable proper numerical conversion and prevent the symbol from being misinterpreted as a text character.
2.  **Converted the data type from string to numeric** for both the 'Profit' and 'Sales' columns.
   - This allows for accurate mathematical operations and aggregations, such as calculating Total Sales and Average Profit.
